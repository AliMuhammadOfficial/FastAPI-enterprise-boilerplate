## ðŸŽ¯ Design Philosophy

- **App-Based Architecture**: Modular structure where each business domain is a separate app
- **Plugin System**: Optional features as plugins that can be enabled/disabled
- **Configuration Driven**: All components are configurable via environment variables
- **Loose Coupling**: Apps communicate via well-defined interfaces
- **Domain-Driven**: Each app represents a bounded context
